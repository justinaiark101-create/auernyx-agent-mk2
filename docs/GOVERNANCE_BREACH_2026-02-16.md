# Governance Breach Report: Dependabot Bypass
## Date: 2026-02-16

### Executive Summary

A critical governance breach was discovered in the auernyx-agent-mk2 repository on February 16, 2026. The `mk2-alteration-gate` workflow contained an explicit bypass for Dependabot that allowed automated dependency updates to merge without any human-in-the-loop (HITL) approval, intent files, or governance oversight.

**Impact:** At least 1 dependency update merged without governance records, violating the fail-closed governance model.

### Breach Details

#### What Happened

The `.github/workflows/mk2-alteration-gate.yml` workflow included the following bypass:

```yaml
jobs:
  gate:
    if: ${{ github.actor != 'dependabot[bot]' }}  # ❌ COMPLETE BYPASS
```

This condition caused the entire governance gate to be skipped whenever Dependabot opened a pull request, allowing dependency updates to merge without:
- Intent file documentation
- Human review and approval
- Ledger records
- Receipt generation
- Any governance oversight

#### When Discovered

**Discovery Date:** 2026-02-16  
**Discovery Method:** Security audit of CI/CD workflows

#### Who Was Responsible

Based on git forensics (`tools/find-dependabot-origin.sh`):

1. **Bypass Introduction:**
   - Commit: `b57661cae9488d69a91da8d7cfe52e986c8c5450`
   - Author: Auernyx <214086463+Ghostwolf101@users.noreply.github.com>
   - Date: 2026-02-16 09:27:13 +0000
   - PR: #17

2. **Dependabot Configuration:**
   - Added in the same commit as the bypass
   - Configured for weekly npm dependency updates
   - Set to open up to 5 PRs at a time

**Analysis:** The bypass was introduced in the same commit that added Dependabot configuration and the alteration gate workflow itself. This suggests the bypass was intentional at the time of implementation, possibly as a perceived convenience feature.

### Affected Pull Requests

Based on audit findings (`tools/audit-dependabot.py`):

#### Confirmed Merged Without Governance

1. **PR #17** (merged 2026-02-16)
   - Commit: `b57661cae9488d69a91da8d7cfe52e986c8c5450`
   - Package: `@types/vscode`
   - Version: 1.108.1 → 1.109.0
   - Risk: LOW (dev dependency, minor version bump)
   - Files Changed: package.json, package-lock.json (plus initial repository setup)
   - Status: Governance restored via retroactive intent

**Note:** The problem statement mentioned additional PRs (#15, #6, #25, #26), but these are not visible in the current repository clone due to shallow history. If these PRs exist in the full GitHub history, they should also be audited and remediated.

### Root Cause Analysis

#### Primary Causes

1. **Convenience Over Security:** The bypass was likely added to avoid the overhead of creating intent files for "routine" dependency updates.

2. **Misunderstanding of Governance Scope:** Dependency updates were incorrectly assumed to be low-risk enough to bypass governance, ignoring:
   - Supply chain attack vectors
   - Breaking changes in dependencies
   - Governance completeness requirements
   - Audit trail integrity

3. **Insufficient Code Review:** The bypass was introduced in the same commit that established the governance framework, suggesting it may not have received adequate scrutiny.

#### Contributing Factors

- No automated tooling existed to generate intent files for Dependabot PRs
- Manual intent file creation was perceived as burdensome
- No explicit documentation about Dependabot governance requirements

### Governance Violations

This breach violated multiple core governance principles:

1. **Fail-Closed by Default:** The bypass created a fail-open path for Dependabot
2. **Human-Readable, Machine-Enforceable:** Automated merges bypassed human review
3. **Complete Audit Trail:** No intent files, ledger entries, or receipts for these changes
4. **Chain of Custody:** No documentation of who approved the changes
5. **No Agent Autonomy:** Dependabot operated with full autonomy, contrary to policy

### Remediation Actions Taken

#### Immediate Actions

1. ✅ **Audit Tooling Created** (`tools/audit-dependabot.py`)
   - Scans git history for Dependabot commits
   - Identifies commits missing intent files
   - Generates forensic reports

2. ✅ **Restoration Tooling Created** (`tools/restore-dependabot-governance.py`)
   - Generates retroactive intent files
   - Marks intents as closed with governance breach amendments
   - Restores audit trail completeness

3. ✅ **Origin Tracing** (`tools/find-dependabot-origin.sh`)
   - Identifies who added Dependabot configuration
   - Traces who added the bypass
   - Documents responsible parties

4. ✅ **Bypass Removed**
   - Removed `if: ${{ github.actor != 'dependabot[bot]' }}` from mk2-alteration-gate.yml
   - All PRs now pass through governance gate, including Dependabot

5. ✅ **Automated Intent Generation** (`.github/workflows/dependabot-gate.yml`)
   - New workflow automatically generates intent files for Dependabot PRs
   - Uses existing `intent_generator.py` tooling
   - Ensures future Dependabot PRs include required governance documentation

6. ✅ **Retroactive Intents Generated**
   - Intent files created for all ungoverned Dependabot commits
   - Marked with `governanceBreach: true` in amendments
   - Audit trail restored

#### Documentation Updates

1. ✅ This breach report (`docs/GOVERNANCE_BREACH_2026-02-16.md`)
2. ✅ CHANGELOG.md updated with breach notice
3. ✅ Intent file for the remediation PR itself

### Prevention Measures

To prevent similar breaches in the future:

1. **Policy:** No conditional bypasses in governance workflows
   - Any `if:` conditions in alteration gate must be explicitly approved
   - Governance gate applies to ALL actors, including bots

2. **Automation:** Automated intent generation for routine changes
   - Dependabot gate workflow handles intent creation
   - Reduces burden while maintaining compliance

3. **Code Review:** Workflow changes require extra scrutiny
   - Changes to `.github/workflows/mk2-alteration-gate.yml` are high-risk
   - Should be classified as "root" or "trunk" changes

4. **Monitoring:** Regular audits of governance compliance
   - Run `tools/audit-dependabot.py` periodically
   - Alert on any ungoverned commits

5. **Documentation:** Clearer guidance on Dependabot governance
   - Document that Dependabot must follow governance
   - Provide tooling to make compliance easy

### Open Items

1. **Full History Audit:** The current repository clone is shallow (grafted). A full audit should be performed against the complete GitHub history to identify any other ungoverned Dependabot PRs (specifically PRs #15, #6, #25, #26 mentioned in the problem statement).

2. **Open PRs:** If PRs #25 and #26 are currently open:
   - Close them
   - Reopen with intent files
   - OR add intent files before merge

3. **Settings Review:** Verify Dependabot settings in GitHub repository configuration
   - Consider limiting to security updates only
   - Adjust auto-merge settings if enabled

4. **Notification:** Inform all repository maintainers of the breach
   - Explain what happened
   - Communicate new governance requirements
   - Train on using automated intent generation

### Lessons Learned

1. **Never Bypass Governance for Convenience:** Even "routine" changes need oversight
2. **Bots Are Not Trusted:** Automated tools must follow the same governance as humans
3. **Supply Chain Security:** Dependency updates are a critical attack vector
4. **Fail-Closed Is Hard:** Requires constant vigilance and tooling support
5. **Automation Enables Compliance:** Make it easy to do the right thing

### Conclusion

This breach, while serious, was discovered quickly and remediated thoroughly. The introduction of automated intent generation for Dependabot PRs converts a governance liability into a governance asset: future dependency updates will be fully documented without manual overhead.

The retroactive intent files restore the audit trail, and the removal of the bypass ensures this specific vulnerability cannot recur.

**Status:** REMEDIATED  
**Audit Trail:** RESTORED  
**Prevention:** AUTOMATED
