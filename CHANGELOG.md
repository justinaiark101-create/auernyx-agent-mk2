# Changelog

## 2026-01-03

- Added top-down regression guard script to validate daemon routing, negotiation, read-only checks, and controlled operations.
- Improved VS Code refusal UX to clearly explain read-only daemon routing and the correct next step.
- Extended launcher to include Smoke Topdown entrypoint and future packaging handoff (cmd → exe) via config.
- Added deterministic icon pipeline (multi-size .ico) and a Desktop shortcut generator using the icon.
- Made CLI read-only-daemon reroute hints PowerShell-friendly (informational output no longer trips error handling when the CLI successfully recovers by routing locally).
